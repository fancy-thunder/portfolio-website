                who specializes in full stack development (React.js & Node.js). I
                am very enthusiastic about bringing the technical and visual
                aspects of digital products to life. User experience, pixel
                perfect design, and writing clear, readable, highly performant

                I began my journey as a web developer in 2015, and since then,
                I've continued to grow and evolve as a developer, taking on new
                challenges and learning the latest technologies along the way.
                Now, in my early thirties, 7 years after starting my web
                development journey, I'm building cutting-edge web applications
                using modern technologies such as Next.js, TypeScript, NestJS,
                Tailwindcss, Supabase and much more.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am very much a progressive thinker and enjoy working on products
                end to end, from ideation all the way to development.

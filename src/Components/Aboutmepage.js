          <p className="about-me-paragraph">Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm <b>a passionate, self-taught developer</b> on a mission to master Full-Stack Web Development. I love bringing the technical and visual aspects of digital products to lifeâ€”because letâ€™s be honest, a website isnâ€™t just about looking good; it should feel good to use too! User experience, clean design, and writing readable, efficient code are things I genuinely care about.<br></br><br></br>
          Iâ€™m currently <b>a 3rd-year Computer Science student at KiiT University, Bhubaneshwar,</b> diving deep into the world of web development. Every day, I push myself to learn, build, and refine my skillsâ€”whether it's through personal projects, working with startups, or just tinkering with new tech. Since starting my journey, Iâ€™ve worked with <b>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Supabase, and more,</b> and while Iâ€™m still a beginner, I love the process of learning, experimenting, and improving. <br></br><br></br>

I thrive on challenges, love picking up new things, and believe that with the right guidance and experience, I can deliver great work. I like to call myself an optimistic and progressive thinkerâ€”someone who's always open to new opportunities and collaboration. <br></br><br></br>

When Iâ€™m not buried in code, youâ€™ll probably find me sharing my journey on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhishek-sen-366960200/" target="_blank" className="socials">LinkedIn</a>, trying to figure out <a href="https://github.com/fancy-thunder" target="_blank" className="socials">GitHub</a>, or just exploring new tech trends. Iâ€™m always up for connecting, learning, and growingâ€”so letâ€™s build something cool together! ðŸš€ <br></br><br></br>  Finally, some quick points about me: <br></br><br></br>
